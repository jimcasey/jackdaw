/// The intermediate-milestone `ExportDestination` (build-order Slice 5): it hands
/// the Kept batch to the system **share sheet** (`UIActivityViewController`) so the
/// owner can drop it into Apple Notes. This is the *only* practical Apple Notes
/// write path — Apple Notes has no clean write API — and it is deliberately
/// scaffolding, not a trustworthy v1 destination (that is Obsidian, Slice 6).
///
/// **DEGRADED confirm (ADR 0001, Candidate A), stated plainly:** the share sheet
/// **cannot** report whether "Save to Notes" actually succeeded — only whether the
/// user *completed* an action versus cancelled. So for this milestone we treat
/// **sheet completion as `confirmed`** for every note in the batch, and **cancel as
/// a retryable `writeFailed`**. That is acceptable precisely because the milestone's
/// job is to exercise the pipeline *above* the seam (serializer + retention machine
/// + batch UX), not to be a verifiable retention path.
///
/// The whole batch is shared as **one** activity — a single share sheet for the
/// Kept set, per the funnel's "clear the inbox in one action" ethos — with the
/// notes' markdown joined into one payload.
