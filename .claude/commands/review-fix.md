Run a full PR review using the `review` skill, then immediately address every issue it finds.

Steps:
1. Invoke the `review` skill to review the current branch's changes.
2. Read the review output carefully.
3. For each issue identified (bugs, style violations, missing tests, architectural concerns, etc.), implement a fix directly in the codebase.
4. After all fixes are applied, commit the changes with a clear message summarizing what was addressed.
5. Push the commit to the current branch.
6. Check the open PR for this branch (use the GitHub MCP tools to find it). Verify:
   - Title is short and descriptive with no issue references (e.g. no `(#N)` suffix) — update if needed.
   - Body includes `Closes #N` (or `Fixes #N`) for any issue this PR resolves — add if missing.
   - Body has a meaningful summary and test plan — add if the body is bare or missing.
   Update the PR via the GitHub MCP tools if any of the above are missing.
7. Summarize what was fixed and note anything that was intentionally left alone (e.g. subjective suggestions or out-of-scope changes).
